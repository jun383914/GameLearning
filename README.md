This is a C# learning project I found online at https://scottlilly.com/build-a-cwpf-rpg/ 

I followed the tutorial and learned as much as I can.

## Notes
### Lesson 03.1
* Introduced basic XAML(stands for Extensible Application Markup Language) operations.
* When you have an open tag, you need a corresponding closing tag by </> (if no contect is in between two tags)or </nameplaceholder>.
* Grid.RowDefinitions: Auto means to adjust based on the size of the content; * means take much space as you can; numbers means pixels it can use.
* Grid.ColumnSpan: define that how many columns you need this class to take.
### Lesson 03.2
* Talks about using repository to track changes and reverse changes if needed.
