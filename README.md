# C# RPG GameLearning

---
This is a C# learning project I found online at https://scottlilly.com/build-a-cwpf-rpg/ 

I followed the tutorial and learned as much as I can. 

The code was posted here for me to get familiar with how to use github, and as a resouce for my future study.

## Notes
### Lesson 03.1
* Introduced basic XAML(stands for Extensible Application Markup Language) operations.
* When you have an open tag, you need a corresponding closing tag by </> (if no contect is in between two tags)or </nameplaceholder>.
* Grid.RowDefinitions: Auto means to adjust based on the size of the content; * means take much space as you can; numbers means pixels it can use.
* Grid.ColumnSpan: define that how many columns you need this class to take.
### Lesson 03.2
* Use repository to track changes and reverse changes if needed.

### Lesson 03.3
* Start with designing games, based on what Nouns project has, create class to reprensent "things" in the game. Those classes will be Models in the game.
* Place Model classes in a sepeate project(project type will be class library) under solution, this will make later auotomated testing easier.
* Analyze what information do you want these "things"(or business object) to hold, what data type will it be? Then place it in the Model class as property so you can control the accessibility of it.
